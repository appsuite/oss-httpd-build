= Items for correction or potential enhancement

== Makefile.gather

 - Handle multiple-releases-found with highest numbered (version semantics)

 - Perform GPG source package validation

 - svn export/git archive specific src snapshots (e.g. apr-1.6-r1789955)?

 - Determine cause of dns failure with make -j parallel updates

== Makefile.preconfig

 - Clean up dependency rules to pick up changes to build/* components
   affecting any automake/autoconf logic, per component

 - Eliminate maintainer mode to avoid automake/autoconf on specific builds

== Makefile.build

 - Correct all dependencies for make -j parallel build

 - Perform validation of system -dev/-devel components

 - Determine any disabled or required APR-util DBD / DBM providers
   (E.g. is the run-time mysql connector to GPL permitted?)

 - Allow brotli / openssl / nghttp2 to be omitted entirely once current

 - Add pcre2 / expat / zlib component dependencies for bleed builds

== Makefile.test

 - Automate the cpan gathering of dependencies noted in httpdtest-trunk/README
   during the assembly of the httpdtest-trunk bld tree.

 - Localize the httpdtest-trunk's flavor of Net::SSL etc, if it is possible,
   relying on the flavor of libcrypto/libssl/openssl which has been prepared
   for the release, to eliminate unexpected X509 formatting side effects and
   potentially other quirks.

== Makefile.package
